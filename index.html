    <h2> Why Tokyo?</h2>
    <p> Everyone asked my husband and I why Tokyo.  We knew we wanted to have kids so we decied that we should take our once
        in a lifetime trip.  We both love anime anything from Naruto to Pokemon.  It was on the top of our must visit lists.
        It's not a cheap place to visit but it amazing in multiple ways.  The transportation is way better than I have ever seen
        in the states.  We took the subway every where and walked.  Each day we averaged 20,000 steps! We visited many different
        attractions while in Tokyo there were many we didn't have the time for so we plan to go back soon!</p>

    <h2>Mount Fuji</h2>
    <p>We got to go on a tour to Mount Fuji. It was a group tour which i have to say I would avoid in the future.  Group tours
        rely on other tourist to be back to the bus on time which cause us a problem.  Anyways the tour was great the tour guid was
        super friendly and informative.  Unfortunatly the day before they had had a avalanche on Mount Fuji which killed 7 high school
        students.  We were supposed to go to the fourth station on the mountain but because of the avalanche the tour group wasn't sure 
        we would even get to go the first station.  We did go to the first station we never could get a good picture of Mount Fuji 
        because of the clouds.</p>

    <h2>Shibuya Station</h2>
    <img src="images/7 way crosswalk.JPG" alt='shibuya crossing' height="600" width="800"/>
    <p>Shibuya Station is one of the most popular stations on the JR subway line. At this station there is the 7 way crossing were 
        people crossing can completely cover the road.  The other thing this station is known for is for the Hatchiko statue.  
        Hatchiko was a dog who waiting for his owner at this train station for 9 years after his owner passed away at work.
        One of our tour guides even informed us that the statue isnt the original!  During world war 2 they melted down the original
        to make bullets for the war.  After the war they remade the statue.</p>

    <h2> Studio Ghibli Tour</h2>
    <img src="images/studio ghibli.JPG" alt='picture of a statue at studio ghibli' height="400" width="600"/>
    <p>Studio Ghibli was one of our favorite parts of Tokyo. The museum was so fun with life size recreated rooms from some of their
    movies.  They had original artwork and interactive displays.  Unfortunatly they didn't allow photography within the museum.
    At the end of the museum there is a ghibli short film that can only be seen there which doesn't have any talking to avoid any 
    language barrier from visiters from other countries.</p>

    <h2>Food in Tokyo</h2>
    <img src="images/street food.JPG" alt='octopus breaded deep fried balls' height="400" width="600"/>
    <p>I could post a million pictures of the food from Tokyo.  These little deep fried octopus balls were my favorite.  I ate them
        almost everyday.  Tokyo had amazing food.  But don't worry it's not only seafood and noodles.  Even my husband the pickiest
        eater on the planet could find something to eat.  They had fast food just like america.  One of my favorite places to eat was 
        this little sushi restruant in shibuya.  There was always a line to get in but it was worth the wait.  You could only stay 1 hour
        max.  That way you got in and out so the line would keep moving.  You ordered your food on a ipad it had pictures for you to 
        click what you wanted and how many.  Don't worry they had cheese fries for my husband haha.  When your order was ready it would
        come on a little train from the kitchen and stop in front of you then your ipad would tell you its your food. It was a crazy
        fun little place.
