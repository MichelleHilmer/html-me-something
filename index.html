    <h2> Why Tokyo?</h2>
    <p> Everyone asked my husband and I why Tokyo.  We knew we wanted to have kids so we decied that we should take our once
        in a lifetime trip.  We both love anime anything from Naruto to Pokemon.  It was on the top of our must visit lists.
        It's not a cheap place to visit but it amazing in multiple ways.  The transportation is way better than I have ever seen
        in the states.  We took the subway every where and walked.  Each day we averaged 20,000 steps! We visited many different
        attractions while in Tokyo there were many we didn't have the time for so we plan to go back soon!</p>

    <h2>Mount Fuji</h2>
    <p>We got to go on a tour to Mount Fuji. It was a group tour which i have to say I would avoid in the future.  Group tours
        rely on other tourist to be back to the bus on time which cause us a problem.  Anyways the tour was great the tour guid was
        super friendly and informative.  Unfortunatly the day before they had had a avalanche on Mount Fuji which killed 7 high school
        students.  We were supposed to go to the fourth station on the mountain but because of the avalanche the tour group wasn't sure 
        we would even get to go the first station.  We did go to the first station we never could get a good picture of Mount Fuji 
        because of the clouds.
