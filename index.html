    <h2> Why Tokyo?</h2>
    <p> Everyone asked my husband and I why Tokyo.  We knew we wanted to have kids so we decied that we should take our once
        in a lifetime trip.  We both love anime anything from Naruto to Pokemon.  It was on the top of our must visit lists.
        It's not a cheap place to visit but it amazing in multiple ways.  The transportation is way better than I have ever seen
        in the states.  We took the subway every where and walked.  Each day we averaged 20,000 steps! We visited many different
        attractions while in Tokyo there were many we didn't have the time for so we plan to go back soon!</p>
